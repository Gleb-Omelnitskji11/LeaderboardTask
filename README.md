# Omelnytskyi Glib, Unity Developer Test Task - Leaderboard Popup

My solution uses Addressabless to access json file and prefab of leaderboard.
I made small changes to SimplePopupSystem to give ability spawn popup on special Canvas.
The remote sprites download by UnityWebRequest and UniTask to await it.
I did not use SpriteAtlas because of it is blocked in project settings.
